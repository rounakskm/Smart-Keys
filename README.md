# Smart-Keys

Repo for RL agent that predicts words as a user types


## Text_corpus
As of now it is a combination of the following books:

1. Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad
2. A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens

All books are obtained from Project Gutenberg

Note: If we train the Network on only one book or works of one author, 
then it will learn the writing style and words used by that author.
Hence we use different books by different authors to make the learning more generalized.
